After more than a month of work for this [release][release_issue] and an
overhaul of its internals, Clack has reached version 1.0!

<!-- sep -->

Fukamachi has been doing a lot of work into improving the performance of various
parts of the HTTP stack, and the results are three libraries:

* [fast-http][fast-http]: An HTTP parser, which sparked a discussion on
  [Hacker News][fast-http-hn].
* [quri][quri]: A fast URI parser.
* [http-body][http-body]: A POST parameter parser.

All focused on performance, all written in pure Common Lisp, all faster than or
close to their C equivalents. The case of fast-http is particularly
impressive, since it has beat the performance of a key part of Silicon Valley's
fastest-growing web ecosystem.

http-body and quri are already a part of Clack, and fast-http will probably be
merged as it matures and proves to be reliable.

For those that are concerned this signals an obsession with microbenchmarks and
optimizations 'for show': Small numbers, at scale, add up to large
slowdowns. Small improvements in parsing HTTP are valuable.

This version also factors out large parts of Clack into external, independent
libraries. For instance, the routing component [clack.util.route][util-route],
which provided a Sinatra-like routing system, has been factored out into the
[myway][myway] library, making it easier for web frameworks built on Clack to
implement a router with minimal effort.

The new version of Clack will arrive in the December [Quicklisp][ql]
distribution, but can be used by cloning the repository locally.
