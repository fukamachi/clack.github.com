<p>Clack is a web application environment for Common Lisp, inspired by Python's WSGI, Ruby's Rack and Perl's Plack. By abstracting HTTP into a simple API, Clack allows your web applications to be portable and be reusable.</p>

<p>If you are already familiar with Web development, you may know why these things so important -- because Web applications are in beta forever.</p>

<p>It means we have to improve applications day by day. Your application would be 3 times larger than you thought. There are many unctions that you did not imagine at the time of development. Accordingly, we have to keep our web applications to be clean, modulable, and be easy to modify.</p>

<p>Besides that, there is another matter. -- Web world goes fast. Probably most of technologies will be changed within 5 years.</p>

<p>What we have to think is, your codes would be applied longer than you imagined. As a result, your application is getting older little by little. Imagine 5 years later. Your web server may be old-fashioned then. Your web framework may be not maintained in the future. Same as libraries you used. What will you do, then? You need to modify your own code written in 5 years ago to catch up the times. I acutually don't know how the job goes, but I guess it seems not so pleasant job.</p>

<p>Clack was developed to solve these problems. Clack works like "glue" of a web application. Clack isn't a web application framework. Clack is a collection of modular components. A web application based on Clack looks like a bunch of reusable components which talks each other.</p>

<p>And, Clack abstracts HTTP and a Web server. You don't need to be aware of what the backend is. Only by rewriting your application just a little, you can run the same code on a different Web server.</p>

<p>Though it isn't possible for me to talk all about how Clack is splendid in this short introduction, I leave some informations that you can judge whether we worth trusted for instead.</p>

<h3>Clack is ready to use</h3>

<p>All the functions of the core of Clack are already implemented in the first official release in June, 2011. Since then, no serious bugs have been found and no changes without backward compatibility have done. Clack seems stable.</p>

<h3>Clack is getting better</h3>

<p>We release Clack <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/clack/tags">every month</a>. There are many kind of changes in them, but, I really wanna say is, continuous improvement has been done. In the process, functions of Clack has been strengthened steadily, and even if a fatal bug was found in future by any chance, we can expect it is fixed by next month.</p>

<h3>Clack is well-documented</h3>

<p>Most of functions, variables and macros in Clack have docstrings. Even packages. Because we think all elements in source files need a documentation string except it is really self-explanatory.</p>

<p>We also provides them as HTML pages at <a href="http://clacklisp.org/doc/">http://clacklisp.org/doc/</a>. It would help you.</p>

<h3>Clack is well-tested</h3>

<p>The reason which only a few bugs were found so far is many unit tests. It has 173 tests now. The test coverage is kept more than 70% (I wanna improve it more, though).</p>

<p>Of course, all releases had passed those all tests, not only on 1 CL implementation but 3 -- Clozure CL, SBCL and CLISP. You can check the current status at <a href="http://ci.clacklisp.org/">http://ci.clacklisp.org/</a>.</p>
